------ Design Phases ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Requiements of design
	- Construct the "Product Requirements Document",
	- List of important requirements that cant be obmitted,
	
- System Specifications
	- Requested behaviours of the system are described,

- Functional Design
	- Defines which subprocesses and sud systems are necessary in the system

- Detailed Design
	-Concrete structure of all modules of which the system must be made,

- Implementation
	- Building and testing prototypes of the system,



What Can Go Wrong?

Hostile Enviroments
	- Every possible factor that can prevent a system from perforing it function,

Failure Modes
	- The manner in which a system fails,



------ Requiements of Design ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	---- Inputs ----
	
	- Read variety of inputs:
		- 0-5V analog,
		- 5V digital,
		- Wide band support/Embeded if possible,
		- Allow custom calibrations,
		- Vehicle speed sensing,
		- Gear sensing,

	- Internal MAP sensor
		- 2 or 3 bar
		- Possibility to be interchangable,

	- Knock Control
		- Dual & single,
		- 

	- Flex fuel
		- 

	- Be able to use any ignition control used my vehicle manufacturers
		-

	- Read and interperate the rotational speed of a crank shaft and cam shaft,
		- Able to control most common ignition systems (COP, single/multi coil),
		- Sequential and wasted spark operation,
		- Individual cyclinder trim,
		- Automotic detection of crank input type (e.g. 36+1 tooth),
		- 

	---- Outputs ----

	- Produce a variety of outputs
		- 0-5V analog,
		- 5V digital,
		- PWM,
		- Tacho,

	- Calculate amount of fuel needed for given engine cycle and parameters
		- Full sequntial operation,
		- Control 1-12 injectors,
		- Individual cyclinder trim,
		- Tune by gear or any other input,
		- Short and long term learning,
		- multi fuel support,
